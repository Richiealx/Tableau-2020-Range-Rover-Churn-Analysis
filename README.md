# Tableau-2020-Range-Rover-Churn-Analysis

Based on the chart you provided, which shows customers and their corresponding payment types, we can analyze the distribution of customers across different payment methods. Here's the analysis:

Customers By Payment Method

1.	Mail Check:
•	Percentage: Approximately 22.9% of customers prefer to make payments through mail checks.
•	Insight: This suggests that a significant portion of customers still opt for traditional payment methods by sending checks through mail.

2.	Bank Transfer:
•	Percentage: Around 21.9% of customers choose to make payments through bank transfers.
•	Insight: Bank transfers are a popular payment method among a significant portion of customers, indicating a preference for electronic fund transfers directly from their bank accounts.

3.	Electronic Check:
•	Percentage: Approximately 33.6% of customers prefer to use electronic checks for their payments.
•	Insight: Electronic checks, which involve digitally authorizing and processing payments, are the most popular payment method among the customers in the given chart.

4.	Credit Card:
•	Percentage: Around 21.6% of customers opt to make payments using credit cards.
•	Insight: Credit card payments are also favored by a notable portion of customers, offering convenience and potential rewards associated with credit card usage.

By analyzing this chart, we can observe the distribution of customers across different payment types, indicating their preferences when it comes to making payments. This information can be valuable for businesses to understand the payment behavior of their customers and cater to their preferred payment methods.

Churn By Contract Type

1.	Month-to-Month:

•	Churn Count: The churn count for month-to-month contracts is 1,655.
•	Insight: This indicates a relatively high churn rate among customers with month-to-month contracts, suggesting that customers with shorter contract durations are more likely to discontinue their services.

2.	One Year:
•	Churn Count: The churn count for one-year contracts is 166.
•	Insight: The churn count for one-year contracts is lower compared to month-to-month contracts. This suggests that customers with one-year contracts are relatively more likely to continue their services for the full duration of their contracts.

3.	Two Years:
•	Churn Count: The churn count for two-year contracts is 48.
•	Insight: The churn count for two-year contracts is the lowest among the three contract types. Customers with longer contract durations, such as two years, demonstrate higher loyalty and are less likely to churn.

By analyzing this chart, we can observe the churn distribution across different contract types, indicating the likelihood of customers discontinuing their services based on the duration of their contracts. This information can be valuable for businesses to understand the impact of contract duration on customer retention and identify strategies to reduce churn.

Churn By Customer Tenure

Based on the chart you provided, which shows churn and their corresponding customer tenure, we can analyze the distribution of churn across different tenure categories. Here's the analysis:

1.	Short-Term Tenure:
•	Churn: The churn rate for customers with short-term tenure is 968.
•	Insight: The relatively high churn rate for short-term tenure suggests that customers who have been with the company for a shorter period are more likely to churn.

2.	Medium-Term Tenure:
•	Churn: The churn rate for customers with medium-term tenure is 283.
•	Insight: The lower churn rate for medium-term tenure indicates that customers who have been with the company for a moderate period are less likely to churn compared to short-term tenure.

3.	Long-Term Tenure:
•	Churn: The churn rate for customers with long-term tenure is 315.
•	Insight: The churn rate for long-term tenure is similar to the medium-term tenure, suggesting that customers with longer tenure are relatively stable and less likely to churn.

4.	Very Long-Term Tenure:
•	Churn: The churn rate for customers with very long-term tenure is 303.
•	Insight: The churn rate for very long-term tenure is similar to long-term tenure, indicating that customers with extended periods of tenure are also likely to remain loyal and less likely to churn.
Overall, the churn rates across different tenure categories vary, with shorter-term customers having a higher churn rate compared to customers with longer tenure. This suggests that customer loyalty tends to increase with longer-term relationships with the company.

Churn By Contract Type

Based on the chart you provided, which shows churn and its corresponding contract type, we can analyze the distribution of churn across different contract types. Here's the analysis:

1.	Month-to-Month Contract:
•	Churn: The churn rate for customers with a month-to-month contract is 1,655.
•	Insight: The relatively high churn rate for month-to-month contracts suggests that customers who have the flexibility to terminate their contract on a monthly basis are more likely to churn.

2.	One-Year Contract:
•	Churn: The churn rate for customers with a one-year contract is 166.
•	Insight: The lower churn rate for one-year contracts indicates that customers who commit to a fixed one-year contract are less likely to churn compared to month-to-month contracts.

3.	Two-Year Contract:
•	Churn: The churn rate for customers with a two-year contract is 48.
•	Insight: The lowest churn rate is observed for customers with a two-year contract, indicating that customers who commit to a longer contract term are the least likely to churn.

Overall, the churn rates vary significantly across different contract types. Customers with month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate, suggesting that the flexibility of terminating the contract on a monthly basis increases the likelihood of churn. On the other hand, customers with longer contract terms, such as one-year or two-year contracts, exhibit lower churn rates, indicating that longer-term commitments provide more stability and reduce the likelihood of churn.
